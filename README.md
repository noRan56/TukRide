## Description

The project is a mobile application that aims to provide users with a transportation service similar to Uber. It addresses the limitations of traditional taxi services by streamlining the transportation process and reducing interaction between users and drivers, resulting in faster, more consistent, and safer transportation experiences.

The mobile application caters to two types of users:

1. Driver:
   - View basic information about the application, including real-time vehicle(tukTuk) tracking on a map.
   - Automatically receive ride assignments from the system, which updates their navigation.
   - Edit their profile (changes require approval from the administrator).
   - Access ride history and generate reports within a specified date range.
   - Accept or decline ride assignments with a mandatory reason for refusal.
   - Toggle their availability for rides manually and become unavailable after exceeding 8 working hours in a day.

2. Passenger:
   - View basic information about the application, including estimated time and cost for transportation between selected destinations.
   - Request a ride and receive constant notifications about the status of the requested ride.
   - Track all available vehicles on a map in real-time.
   - Make payment at the time of booking and rate the driver after the ride.
   - Select multiple destinations for a ride, either in a preferred order or based on the system's recommended route.
   - Schedule rides for the future to prioritize assignment during peak hours.
   - Access complete ride history.
   - Update profile information and contact support for inquiries.
